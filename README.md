Code and required calibration documents are to be saved here

Calibration files and the like should be in their own folders,
however python/matlab files containing computed values can be stored
here. Everything stored here should make sense in a git commit.

Text documents describing file structure is also a good fit for here.

## analyse_drop_fall.py

Details to come

## determine_threshold.py

Determine optimal thresholding for droplet images.

Inputs: File of droplet video, frame number to analyse

It is advisable to run this a few times for differently numbered frames and
to take the average of that. This process can vary wildly dependnig on lots
of things.
