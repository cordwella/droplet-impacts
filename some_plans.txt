Software plans
--------------------------------

This is for the phase plot

- get a list of all of the videos to be included in the phase plot
- from their naming etc identify which settings for processing to use (contrast, top height, impact line, how to identify start and stop)

Processing the video (top down):
- Find frame of full entry into the video
- Find frame of initial impact 
- Calculate Weber Numbers volumes etcg
- full graph can be reported, but actually only record a summary
MVP: Ask the user to identify it as crown, splash, or spread at maximum spread (speed modification on thing? What already exists for this?)
Later on, attempt to do some more qualitative calculations of this (including max height, time to maxium height, maxium spread (diameter)) Take a guess at this point, but still allow for human intervention, max height is the max height of the rosensweig instability


full graphs should be generatable (for checking etc) but not saved directly


Save this data to a file (csv/database etc) with columns
file id, filename, (date, who took the data, when processed etc), final weber number, initial final and average volume, maximum spread, max height, time to max height


Allow for some overwriting/updating in the database? sqlite would make this really easy to do ... 
However I think the initial priority is not that? I'm unsure what my priority should be in terms of developing this, i do love sqlite tho ...


-> if I was doing this in matlab or plain text it wouldn't be too hard to go from the ids, and delete all but the most recent one with that ID -> hash tables are nice



I think the initial priority is to look at the existing code, see what I can steal and how much better matlab could be -> what would I gain from it when I lose all of my familiarty and speed when it comes to python, and also note that I would most likely have to work on windows for either, which makes my linux skills moot

this then brings me onto enviroment and interaction questions which blah
